# Akashic Notes

The Akashic Notes project defines a data format, set of tools, and a web application for collaboration. This site defines the motivation for the project and will eventually be transformed into a landing and documentation site.

It is very much a work in progress scratch pad for now, so please check back in a year or two.

## Projects


### Capture

Ideas strike like lightning, suddenly, fleetingly, and anywhere (todo, reword, unknown location). It is important to be ready to capture them before they are lost.

We provide a set of tools (webextension, phone app (android only), and cli) for this capture.


### Knowledge


TODO(make hook, call to action)


Own your data.
  The moat of SaaS companies should be product, make them compete!
  Fallback to something you have forever.
  

Why not Solid?
	sacrifices personal usability
		collaboration should be optional superset
	akashic prioritizes personal use


Data Format
simplest is merely a directory
superset is git repo with symlinks (separately optional), supports cloning (trilium style) and merging




### Visualization

optional invisible layer for existing websites
library for sites w/ data (TODO: use w/ this site as example)


### Filter


The deluge of information that is the internet is difficult to navigate. We typically rely on search or crowdsourcing to find what we are looking for.

Not much better since 2000s (maybe llms will change that, e.g. perplexity?). The diaspora of informational sites has generally been consolidate.g. (e.g. reddit, hackernews, influencers). These have been hijacked by miscellaneous interests, including both explicit censorship as well as drowning information through moblike thinking.

Here we provide some filtering tools (for common search and collaboration sites) to take back control over what you see.
People want different things, customizable...
The intent is to become a ublock for ideas, more fine grained than e.g. reddit...


### Collaboration
